# Simple SHA256 Checker

## Overview

The **Simple SHA256 Checker** allows you to easily verify the integrity of files by comparing their SHA256 hash values against known malicious hashes. It is a straightforward solution for detecting obvious malicious code, **obviously not intended for advanced security analysis**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is not a full antivirus solution - it only checks for exact hash matches against known malicious files.

---

## Features

- **Fast and Easy**: Quickly check if a file's hash matches a known good hash using Rust.
- **Recursive Checking**: The tool checks **EXE** and **DLL** files recursively to ensure that all relevant files in a directory are verified.
- **Malicious File/Code Detection**: Useful for identifying blatantly malicious files.
- **Known Malicious SHA256 Hashes**: Download and select a TXT list of known Malicious SHA256 hashes from [Malware Bazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/) to compare against.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Directory**: Choose the directory containing the **EXE** and **DLL** files you want to check.
2. **Download and Select Trusted Hash List**: Download a TXT list of known trusted SHA256 hashes from [Bazaar Abuse](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/), and upload it into the tool.
3. **Recursive Scan**: The tool will recursively scan all **EXE** and **DLL** files in the selected directory and its subdirectories.
4. **Generate SHA256 Hash**: The tool computes the SHA256 hash for each EXE an DLL in the folder.
5. **Compare Against Malicious Hashses**: The tool compares each computed hash against the provided list of un-trusted SHA256 hashes. If the file's computed hash matches any of the trusted hashes, then the file is most likely Malicious.
